ADNI-3 MRI Protocol   
• Running the Advanced protocol requires both hardware and software support.  • Hardware: a high channel count receiver array and high performance imaging gradients are taken as requisite to run the ADNI-3 Advanced protocol. •  Commonly, suitable hardware to run the  ADNI-3 Advanced protocols has become available ahead of software support.  This table speculates, based largely on hardware, which protocols may be in use circa 2018-2019. Scanner Table Brief History of ADNI: The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)  is a longitudinal natural history study.  Data from ADNI is publicly available (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). The third phase of  ADNI (ADNI-3) began in late 2016, with subject imaging beginning in earnest in mid-2017. MRI developments for ADNI-1 (2004-2009) focused on consistent longitudinal structural imaging on 1.5T scanners using T1- and T2-weighted sequences.  One-fourth of ADNI-1 subjects were also scanned using essentially the same protocol on 3T scanners.   In ADNI-GO/ADNI-2 (2010-2016) imaging was performed at 3T with T1-weighted imaging parameters similar to ADNI-1.   In place of the T2-weighted image from ADNI-1,  2D-FLAIR and T2*-weighted imaging was added at all sites. Fully sampled and accelerated T1-weighted images were acquired in each imaging session. Advanced imaging was included depending on scanner manufacturer:  diffusion imaging on GE scanners,  resting state functional MRI on Philips scanners and arterial spin labeling on Siemens scanners. ADNI-3 imaging is being done exclusively on 3T scanners.  Nearly all of the imaging sequences from ADNI-2 have been updated for inclusion in ADNI-3.  Each of the ADNI-2 “advanced imaging” sequences is now included in all protocols with a few site-wise exceptions related to sequence license issues. Scope of ADNI: ADNI imaging is carried out at 57 imaging centers on subjects enrolled at 59 clinical sites. Two of the imaging centers each serve two enrolling sites.  Scanners from the three largest MRI vendors (GE, Philips and Siemens) are supported across nearly all of the current software configurations.  ADNI subjects are only a small part of the workflow at each imaging center so ADNI has no control over scanner system upgrades.    Introduction Rationale: ADNI is funded through a public/private partnership in order to establish multi-site imaging methods suitable for inclusion in drug studies as well to investigate Alzheimer’s disease progression.  In order to create imaging protocols that can be used to support drug studies it is necessary to restrict the sequences employed to those commercially available on scanners.

Rationale: There is a broad gulf between older MRI systems and the state of the art production systems within each vendor’s product line.  The range of scanners being qualified for use in ADNI scanning as of late 2016 is given in the Scanner Table.   A two-tiered approach is taken to accommodate the range of variability in scanners. Thus, “ADNI-3 Basic” and “ADNI-3 Advanced” protocols have been created.  An underlying assumption is that scanners will be upgraded replaced over the lifespan of ADNI-3 leading to increased use of the ADNI-3 Advanced protocols.    Structural T1-weighted, 3D FLAIR, T2* GRE, ASL, and high resolution images of the hippocampus are common across basic and advanced protocols within each vendor.   The Advanced Diffusion MRI and Resting State fMRI scans take advantage of simultaneous multislice  acceleration for echo-planar images (EPI).  For longitudinal consistency, they can be down-sampled post-scan to match the Basic sequences.

Parameters will vary based on system hardware and software. • Unless otherwise stated the ADNI-3 Basic and Advanced protocols share the same parameters.  For example the MP-RAGE is the same in both protocols while diffusion and fMRI differ. • Choice of ASL sequence is driven almost entirely by sequence availability:  3D pCASL being preferred if available. • ADNI-3 data and  protocol information is maintained at http://adni.loni.usc.edu ADNI-3 Sequence Parameters
